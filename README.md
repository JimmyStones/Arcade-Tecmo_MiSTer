# Rygar (1986)

Rygar was one of my favourite arcade games as a kid. It was originally built in 1986 by Tecmo, a Japanese video game company, and saw later releases on consoles like Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, etc.

I began this project by writing an [emulator](https://github.com/nullobject/rygar-emu), so I could focus on learning how the arcade game works, without having to worry about the FPGA side of things. I kept detailed project notes while working on both the emulator and FPGA core, which will be turned into a series of [blog posts](https://joshbassett.info).
